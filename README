FUNCTIONS

FREZCHEM\
[P,T,rho_b] = brine_density_FREZCHEM(fn)
brine_density_FREZCHEM(fn) extracts the temperature and brine density (where ice is stable) from the output file of a FREZCHEM v13.3 or 15.1 simulation, including a data point at the pure ice pressure melting temperature obtained from Tmelt(P).
