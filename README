T = Tsub(P)
Tsub(P) calculates the sublimation temperature (T) of ice Ih given pressure (P) using the equations originally published by Wagner et al. (2011), included in the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) Revised Release on the Pressure along the Melting and Sublimation Curves of Ordinary Water Substance: IAPWS R14-08(2011).

T = Tsat(P)
Tsat(P) calculates the saturation temperature (T) of water given pressure (P) using the equations included in the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) Revised Release on the IAPWS Industrial Formulation 1997 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Water and Steam: IAPWS R7-97(2012).

P = Pmelt(T)  
Pmelt(T) calculates the melting pressure (P) of ice Ih as a function of temperature (T) using the equations of state originally published by Wagner et al. (2011), included in the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) Revised Release on the Pressure along the Melting and Sublimation Curves of Ordinary Water Substance: IAPWS R14-08(2011).

P = Psub(T)
Psub(T) calculates the sublimation pressure (P) of ice Ih given temperature (T) using the equations of state originally published by Wagner et al. (2011), included in the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) Revised Release on the Pressure along the Melting and Sublimation Curves of Ordinary Water Substance: IAPWS R14-08(2011).

P = Psat(T)
Psat(T) calculates the saturation pressure (P) of water given temperature (T) using the equations included in the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) Revised Release on the IAPWS Industrial Formulation 1997 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Water and Steam: IAPWS R7-97(2012).

rho = water_density(T,P)  
water_density(T,p) calculates the density of water as a function of temperature (T) and pressure (P) using the equations of state, originally published by Feistel et al. (2003, 2008), included in the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) Supplementary Release on a Computationally Efficient Thermodynamic Formulation for Liquid Water for Oceanographic Use: IAPWS SR7-09.

ice_density(T,P) calculates the density of ice Ih using the equations of state, originally published by Wagner et al. (2011), included in the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) Revised Release on the Equation of State 2006 for H2O Ice Ih: IAPWS R10-06(2009).

FrOut = read_FrOut(fn)  
read_FrOut reads a FREZCHEM output file and calls either read_FrOut133(fn) or read_FrOut151(fn), depending on the version of the output file, to create the structure FrOut. 

FrOut = read_FrOut133(fn)  
read_FrOut133(fn) creates a structure (FrOut) from a FREZCHEM v13.3 output file (fn) that contains bulk properties, solution properties, and solid properties at each convergent temperature step. It also estimates solid properties at the eutectic temperature (as opposed to the final convergent temperature step).

FrOut = read_FrOut151(fn)  
read_FrOut151(fn) creates a structure (FrOut) from a FREZCHEM v15.1 output file (fn) that contains bulk properties, solution properties, and solid properties at each convergent temperature step. It also estimates solid properties at the eutectic temperature (as opposed to the final convergent temperature step).

[T,Sb] = liquidus_FREZCHEM(fn)  
liquidus_FREZCHEM extracts the temperature and brine salinity (where ice is stable) from the output file of a FREZCHEM v13.3 or 15.1 simulation, including a data point at the pure ice pressure melting temperature obtained from Tmelt(p). 

[Tmat,Smat,Vi_V, Vb_V, Vs_V] = volume_fraction_FREZCHEM(T,S,fn)  
volume_fraction_FREZCHEM(T,S,fn) calculates the volume fraction of ice (Vi_V), brine (Vb_V), and solid salt (Vs_V) as a function of temperature (T) and bulk ice salinity (S), using the phase behavior functions derived from the FREZCHEM output file (fn).

[T,F1,F2,F3] = F1F2F3_FREZCHEM(fn)
F1F2F3_FREZCHEM(fn) derives phase behavior functions from the FREZCHEM output file (fn).
