FUNCTIONS
[P,T,rhob] = brine_density_FREZCHEM(fn)
brine_density_FREZCHEM(fn) extracts the temperature and brine density (where ice is stable) from the output file of a FREZCHEM v13.3 or 15.1 simulation, including a data point at the pure ice pressure melting temperature obtained from Tmelt(P).

[P,T,F1,F2,F3,k_star,rho_ss] = F1F2F3_FREZCHEM(fn)
F1F2F3_FREZCHEM(fn) derives phase behavior functions from the FREZCHEM output file (fn).

[P,T,Sb] = liquidus_FREZCHEM(fn)
liquidus_FREZCHEM extracts the temperature and brine salinity (where ice is stable) from the output file of a FREZCHEM v13.3 or 15.1 simulation, including a data point at the pure ice pressure melting temperature obtained from Tmelt(P). 

FrOut = read_FrOut(fn)  
read_FrOut reads a FREZCHEM output file and calls either read_FrOut133(fn) or read_FrOut151(fn), depending on the version of the output file, to create the structure FrOut. 

FrOut = read_FrOut133(fn)  
read_FrOut133(fn) creates a structure (FrOut) from a FREZCHEM v13.3 output file (fn) that contains bulk properties, solution properties, and solid properties at each convergent temperature step. It also estimates solid properties at the eutectic temperature (as opposed to the final convergent temperature step).

FrOut = read_FrOut151(fn)  
read_FrOut151(fn) creates a structure (FrOut) from a FREZCHEM v15.1 output file (fn) that contains bulk properties, solution properties, and solid properties at each convergent temperature step. It also estimates solid properties at the eutectic temperature (as opposed to the final convergent temperature step).

[P,Tmat,Smat,Vi_V, Vb_V, Vs_V] = volume_fraction_FREZCHEM(T,S,fn)  
volume_fraction_FREZCHEM(T,S,fn) calculates the volume fraction of ice (Vi_V), brine (Vb_V), and solid salt (Vs_V) as a function of temperature (T) and bulk ice salinity (S), using the phase behavior functions derived from the FREZCHEM output file (fn).
